          <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have worked in the library sciences field for most of my adult life, which has given me ample opportunity to work with various software platforms and hardware. I spend a lot of time troubeshooting and training people with various levels of skill.  At home, I have explored various <strong>Linux Distros (<em>Fedora was a challenging and rewarding experiment for me</em>) and work with both Mac OS and Windows.</strong></p>
            <p>Quite a few friends have left other careers to pursue futures in programming or other tech jobs.  I am still exploring what I want to do, but technical writing and user experience are both interesting fields.  I am also very interested in cybersecurity.</p>
            <p>In the rest of my life, I enjoy biking, playing basketball, hiking, mushroom hunting, pinball, playing music and writing, and watching bad movies on vhs.  I also enjoy <span style="color:blue"><a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/"> oxford commas</a> and reading.</span></p>
